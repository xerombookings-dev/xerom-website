# QA Report

## Production release gates: 2026-10-08

The owner authorized GitHub publication and automatic Cloudflare deployment to `xeromracing.com`. The client dashboard was inspected in the existing Safari session: repository `xerombookings-dev/xerom-website`, branch `main`, root `/`, build `npm run build`, deploy `npx wrangler deploy`, with the existing public Turnstile build variable. No dashboard setting was changed. The coordinator's existing version `172bde2c` serves 100% of traffic; its deployment follows the last coordinator source commit (`af2f293`, 2026-09-26). No coordinator source/binding change is included, so no manual coordinator deployment is required.

| Pre-push gate | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Dependency audit | Pass | The initial `npm audit --omit=dev` found 10 existing advisories. Compatible updates and scoped overrides now produce `found 0 vulnerabilities`. Astro 7.3.2, adapter 14.3.1 and Wrangler 4.130.0 are unchanged. Patch details and primary advisory sources are in `docs/agent/DECISIONS.md`. |
| Lint/typecheck | Pass | Both `npm run lint` and `npm run check`: 0 errors, warnings or hints across 140 files with the patched lockfile. |
| Unit/integration tests | Pass | `npm test`: 144 passed across 26 files, including the exactly-one-success concurrency regression. |
| Image integrity | Pass | `npm run assets:verify`: 42 derivatives verified using Sharp 0.35.5. |
| Production-equivalent build | Pass | `npm run build` with the publicly served production Turnstile widget key, `SITE_URL=https://xeromracing.com`, `PUBLIC_STAGING_SITE=0`. The key was passed only through the local process environment. |
| Website packaging | Pass | `WRANGLER_LOG_PATH=/tmp/xerom-wrangler.log npx wrangler deploy --dry-run`: generated `dist/server/wrangler.json`, 74 client assets and expected existing bindings. No upload. |
| Coordinator packaging | Pass | `WRANGLER_LOG_PATH=/tmp/xerom-wrangler.log npx wrangler deploy --dry-run --config coordinator/wrangler.race-control.jsonc`: 878.54 KiB / gzip 143.99 KiB; unchanged coordinator code. No upload. |
| Final full browser regression | Pass | `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4323 VISUAL_VARIANT=copy-cleanup-2026-10-08 npm run test:e2e`: 103 passed, 59 expected viewport-specific skips, 0 failures on one fresh mock-mode server with patched dependencies. |
| Live preflight | Pass, read-only | All 12 public page/robots/sitemap URLs returned 200 with apex canonical metadata and no public noindex tag. `/book` has its production Turnstile widget. Public config and availability returned 200 (21 slots), owner UI/API redirected to Access, and `www` redirected with 308 to the apex. |

The first browser run after dependency patching was aborted: two local dev servers plus concurrent build/check commands conflicted over Vite's generated dependency cache, causing missing optimized modules. Both task-owned servers were stopped, `node_modules/.vite/` was cleared, and one fresh server was started. Local page preflight returned 200 and the complete final browser rerun passed. This was a local validation failure; nothing had been pushed or deployed at that point.

Review screenshots remain local in the dated folders listed below. Historical screenshot baselines were preserved. Production build/deployment evidence will be recorded after Cloudflare processes the release commit; no live reservation test is part of this presentation release.

## Production copy cleanup: 2026-10-08

Environment: local Astro 7.3.2 / Cloudflare adapter 14.3.1, Node 26.10.0, Playwright Chromium 153.0.8010.12, `http://127.0.0.1:4323`. No `.dev.vars` or Google credentials were present. Public booking used mock mode; owner booking/config responses requiring writes were intercepted by the browser suite. No production Calendar event, R2 publication or deployment was performed.

Scope: replace the owner-reviewed public draft text, retain/disclose illustrative images, remove the unused Lorem ipsum component, clarify form hints, and replace synthetic Race Control schedules/booking rows with accurate connection/search states. The final review fixed a clipped phone-table message and kept the disconnected inspector in document flow at tablet widths.

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Lint | Pass | `npm run lint`: Astro diagnostics, 0 errors / warnings / hints across 140 files. |
| Typecheck | Pass | `npm run check`: 0 errors / warnings / hints across 140 files. |
| Unit/integration regressions | Pass | `npm test`: 144 tests passed across 26 files. |
| Final-resource race | Pass, local regression | `tests/race-control/booking-concurrency.test.ts`, included in the unit run, submits two simultaneous attempts through `SerializedExecutor` and asserts one `201`, one `409`, and zero remaining capacity. This is not a new live Google Calendar race test. |
| Production build | Pass | `npm run build`: Cloudflare server output completed. |
| Image integrity | Pass | `npm run assets:verify`: all 42 manifested image derivatives verified. Only manifest wording/date changed; source photos and placeholder bitmaps are unchanged. |
| Full final browser suite | Pass | `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4323 VISUAL_VARIANT=copy-cleanup-2026-10-08 npm run test:e2e`: 103 passed, 59 expected viewport-specific skips, 0 failures. |
| Booking register states | Pass | Browser regression at all six widths verifies initial guidance, an intentionally held loading response, loaded records/headings, a subsequent `503`, removal of previous rows, retry guidance and empty-state width. |
| Console, network, assets and links | Pass, local | Core-route E2E checks no browser console errors, failed requests or broken images. `node .impeccable/review/copy-cleanup-2026-10-08/audit.mjs` additionally audited 36 page/viewport combinations: 0 console/JS/request/HTTP errors, 0 page overflow, and all 24 distinct internal linked URLs returned success. External destinations were not revalidated. |
| Keyboard/focus/reduced motion | Pass for exercised flow | E2E verifies mobile menu focus containment/Escape, booking flow and reduced-motion slideshow behavior. The supplemental audit Tabs into all 36 views and verifies a visible 3px focus outline. The new Calendar connection link was clicked at each width and opened `/race-control/connection`. |
| Visual review | Pass for changed copy/states | Inspected `review-375.png`, `review-390.png`, `review-430.png`, `review-768.png`, `review-1024.png`, `review-1440.png` in `.impeccable/review/copy-cleanup-2026-10-08/`. Checked wrapping, illustration disclosure, empty-state placement and phone-table guidance. |
| Diff/source scan | Pass | `git diff --check`; no rendered Lorem ipsum, owner-content-pending, placeholder-page, future-feature, mock-customer or synthetic-reservation copy remains in Astro templates. Functional phone/search examples and image provenance remain. |
| Staging/production integration | Not run | No deployment or live Google/Turnstile/R2 action was requested. Production Access and manual screen-reader operation were not exercised. |

Bootstrap: the default agent-detected Astro background server hid a sandbox `listen EPERM` failure. The local server started with approved loopback permissions using `ASTRO_DEV_BACKGROUND=1 npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4323`. An intermediate run after the mobile-table adjustment failed the old assertion that column headings must be visible before results exist; that assertion now runs after actual records load, and the full final suite passes.

Evidence: individual route screenshots and `browser-audit.json` are under `.impeccable/review/copy-cleanup-2026-10-08/`. Full homepage evidence is under `.impeccable/review/homepage-upgrade/copy-cleanup-2026-10-08/`; owner schedule E2E screenshots are under `.impeccable/review/copy-cleanup-2026-10-08/race-control/`. Screenshot tests now honor `VISUAL_VARIANT` so this review preserves historical screenshot files.

### Copy and UI delivery gate (scoped to this change)

| Rule | Status and evidence |
|---|---|
| R-02, copy hygiene | Pass: new customer-facing prose contains no em dash or internal replacement instruction. |
| R-03, responsive containment | Pass: all six widths visually inspected; browser page-overflow checks and empty-table width assertions pass. |
| R-17, factual numbers | Pass: no prices, capacities, hours or numerical business claims were invented or changed. |
| R-18, testimonials | Pass: none added. |
| R-23, assets | Pass: the owner authorized keeping the temporary images; no new product visual asset was created. |
| R-24, navigation | Pass: the new connection link was clicked at six widths; 24 distinct internal destinations returned success. |
| R-25, text contrast | Pass: existing approved tokens give muted text 9.55:1 on panels and 10.13:1 on canvas; the hero disclosure's worst-case white-photo background gives 6.25:1. Calculations are retained in `browser-audit.json`. |
| R-26, new controls | Pass: the connection action opens a real page; fake inspector actions are removed and refresh is disabled while disconnected. |
| R-27, states | Pass: explicit connection, initial, loading, empty-result and error states replace synthetic records. Loading/error transitions are exercised in E2E. |
| R-28, FAQ | Pass: no generic FAQ added. |
| R-32, keyboard | Pass: visible focus on all audited views; existing menu and booking keyboard checks pass. |
| R-33, authored source | Pass: source/CSS edits were made directly with patches; screenshot review sheets are QA artifacts. |
| R-34, themes | Pass: no theme controls or palette changes introduced. |
| R-35, execution | Pass: production build and full local browser suite pass; new connection link click-through is recorded. |
| R-36, unsupported claims | Pass: membership availability and Instagram guidance follow `PRODUCT.md` / `CONTENT_TODO.md`; no security, performance or customer claims added. |
| R-37, direction | Pass: existing Race Control Broadcast public identity and calm owner-panel direction retained; no new design direction selected. |
| R-38, fabricated content | Pass: synthetic bookings/customers are removed from application markup; the retained AI hero stays disclosed and marked in provenance. |
| Purpose gate | Pass: existing panels and typography remain; disconnected details flow inline to avoid obstructing controls, and empty table states fit the visible width so guidance is readable. |
| Liveliness/consistency | Pass: approved public identity, wordmark, hierarchy and motion remain; owner empty states use the existing operational visual language. |
| Craftsmanship/quality locks | Pass for changed surfaces: six-width review, focus checks, accurate copy, meaningful destinations and state regression tests are recorded above. |

## Booking setup card order — 2026-09-27

Environment: local Astro / Cloudflare adapter; booking endpoints configured in mock mode. No booking was submitted.

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Astro diagnostics and typecheck | Pass | `npm run check`: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 hints across 141 files. |
| Unit tests | Pass | `npm test`: 144 passed across 26 files. |
| Production build | Pass | `npm run build`: Cloudflare server output completed. |
| Booking-order browser assertion | Pass | `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://xerom-website.xerombookings.workers.dev npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/site.spec.ts --project=mobile-375 --grep "booking setup presents Pro Rig"`: 1 passed against the deployed public page. It only opened `/book`; no booking was submitted. |
| Full local Playwright suite | Environment blocked | `npm run test:e2e` and direct Astro dev both exited before the server became ready with `Dev server process exited before becoming ready`. `npx playwright test --list` enumerated the suite, but the local browser run did not start. |
| Broader setup validation on deployed page | Partial | Its order assertion passed, then the existing test failed at its “maximum 3 regular rigs available” copy check against the deployed configuration. The isolated order test above passes. |
| Public deployment smoke | Pass | The deployed `/book` page loaded at 375px with Pro Rig, Regular Rig, PS5 Lounge in that order. `npx wrangler deployments status --name xerom-website` could not run because this environment has no `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`. |
| Staging build | Not run | `PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` is not configured in this local environment; the main-branch Workers Build supplies its deployment configuration. |

No screenshot was captured. The focused remote browser check did not create or change Calendar events.

## Mobile membership menu parity — 2026-09-25

Environment: local Astro mock-mode E2E at `http://127.0.0.1:4323` and deployed Workers site at `https://xerom-website.xerombookings.workers.dev`. Browser checks only opened public pages; no booking was submitted.

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile menu behavior | Pass | `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4323 npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/site.spec.ts`: 41 passed, 43 expected viewport skips across six widths. At 375, 390, 430, and 768px, the mobile menu's “BECOME A MEMBER!” link points to `/membership` and opens the same placeholder page as the desktop CTA. |
| Deployed mobile click-through | Pass | `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://xerom-website.xerombookings.workers.dev npm run test:e2e -- --project=mobile-390 --grep "mobile membership menu link opens the shared placeholder"`: 1 passed. |

## Choose Your Setup frame height adjustment — 2026-09-25

Environment: local Astro / Cloudflare adapter in mock booking mode at `http://127.0.0.1:4323`.

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Astro diagnostics / lint | Pass | `npm run check` and `npm run lint`: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 hints across 136 files. |
| Unit and contract tests | Pass | `npm test`: 128 passed across 24 files. |
| Production build | Pass | `npm run build`: Cloudflare server output completed. |
| Responsive frame and overflow | Pass | `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4323 npm run test:e2e -- --grep "homepage presents the approved story without overflow"`: 6 passed across 375, 390, 430, 768, 1024, and 1440px. Each viewport keeps the frame at 5:4 with no horizontal overflow. |
| Deployed responsive homepage | Pass | `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://xerom-website.xerombookings.workers.dev npm run test:e2e -- --grep "homepage presents the approved story without overflow"`: 6 passed across the same six widths; the live 390px frame measures 374×299px. |
| Mobile visual inspection | Pass | At 390px, the frame measures 374×299px and fits the page. Updated capture: `.impeccable/review/homepage-upgrade/setup-slideshow/mobile-390.png`. |

## Choose Your Setup swipe-only slideshow — 2026-09-25

Environment: local Astro / Cloudflare adapter in mock booking mode at `http://127.0.0.1:4323`. No live booking backend or Google Calendar state was touched.

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Astro diagnostics, lint, and typecheck | Pass | `npm run check` and `npm run lint`: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 hints across 136 files. |
| Unit and contract tests | Pass | `npm test`: 128 passed across 24 files. |
| Production build | Pass | `npm run build`: Cloudflare server output completed. |
| Responsive homepage checks | Pass | `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4323 npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/site.spec.ts`: 37 passed, 41 expected viewport skips across 375, 390, 430, 768, 1024, and 1440px. The 4:3 frame stayed fixed and the homepage had no horizontal overflow. |
| Slideshow interaction | Pass | The 1024px E2E check confirmed 3.5-second advance, image readiness before rotation, keyboard focus pause/resume, arrow-key navigation, and reduced-motion pause. The 390px touch test swiped to the next photo. |
| Visual inspection | Pass | Reviewed the 390px mobile homepage capture at `.impeccable/review/homepage-upgrade/setup-slideshow/mobile-390.png`; no visible slideshow controls, and the fixed image frame fits the viewport. |
| Public-site effects | None | Validation used the local mock booking server. No live booking or Calendar event was created. |

## Membership CTA placeholder route — 2026-09-25

Environment: local Astro 7.3.2 checks and the deployed Workers site at `https://xerom-website.xerombookings.workers.dev`. Live browser checks only opened public pages; no booking was submitted.

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Git history | Pass | `git show 8850d13^:src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` confirms the white `.header-membership` CTA linked to `/membership`; commit `a1958dc` introduced the explicit no-registration placeholder. |
| Astro diagnostics, lint, and typecheck | Pass | `npm run check` and `npm run lint`: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 hints across 135 files. |
| Unit and contract tests | Pass | `npm test`: 128 passed across 24 files. |
| Production build | Pass | `npm run build`: Cloudflare server output completed. |
| Membership CTA click-through | Pass | `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://xerom-website.xerombookings.workers.dev npm run test:e2e -- --grep "membership header CTA opens its explicit placeholder"`: 2 passed at desktop 1024/1440px; 4 expected mobile/tablet skips. The CTA opens `/membership`; the placeholder states registration and purchase are unavailable and retains a `/book` action. |
| Live visual inspection | Pass | Clicked the white CTA in the live desktop header at 1080px. Captured and reviewed `.impeccable/review/homepage-upgrade/membership-cta/desktop-1024.png`. |
| Full local Playwright suite | Environment blocked | `npm run test:e2e` could not start the configured Astro dev web server (`Process from config.webServer exited early`). The focused deployed click-through test above passed. |

## Owner configuration close-out — 2026-09-24

Environment: local Astro 7.3.2 / Cloudflare Workers adapter using the mock booking mode for browser tests. No customer Calendar booking was submitted during this close-out.

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Astro diagnostics / lint | Pass | `npm run lint`: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 hints across 135 files. |
| Unit and contract tests | Pass | `npm test`: 128 passed across 24 files, including public-note rejection, rolling-horizon text and the 15-minute no-show threshold. |
| Production build | Pass | `npm run build`: Cloudflare server output completed. |
| Media provenance | Pass | `npm run assets:verify`: 21 manifested derivatives verified; owner photos and placeholders were not changed. |
| Wrangler deployment dry-run | Pass | `npx wrangler deploy --dry-run` packaged the Worker with coordinator, both private R2 buckets, all five rate-limit bindings and assets. |
| Coordinator dry-run | Pass | `npm run coordinator:deploy -- --dry-run` compiled the active `xerom-race-control-coordinator` and its Durable Object/R2 bindings. |
| No-show grace enforcement | Pass | Unit coverage checks the 15-minute boundary and invalid start values; Race Control disables the action until the grace ends and the coordinator independently returns 409 before then. |
| Responsive/browser checks | Pass | `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4321 npm run test:e2e`: 70 passed, 38 intentional viewport/project skips, 0 failures across 375, 390, 430, 768, 1024 and 1440 CSS px. |
| New owner-facing pages | Pass | `/booking-policy`, `/privacy`, `/events`, and `/whats-new` returned 200 with visible headings and no broken images or browser errors in the route suite. |
| Visual inspection | Pass | Reviewed `.impeccable/review/homepage-upgrade/after/mobile-390.png` and `desktop-1440.png`; header, temporary hero, pricing cards, visit details and policy footer links render without horizontal overflow. |
| Calendar side effects | None | No booking, Calendar event, or event deletion was performed in this close-out. The previously approved race test was already cleaned up as recorded below. |

The first Playwright startup attempts collided with stale local Astro dev processes and a stale Vite optimized-SSR cache, which returned HTTP 500. Those repo-local processes were stopped; the suite was rerun against a fresh verified `200` server and passed in full. This startup issue did not affect the production build or Wrangler dry-run.

The owner directed us to keep the current social-group hero and social-share images until replacement photos are supplied. The canonical hostname and those photos remain pending. The current workers.dev deployment stays `noindex`; domain cutover and Turnstile hostname updates are not included in this verification.

### Deployed verification

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Workers Build | Pass | Commit `8850d13` built successfully from `main`; Worker version `64044039-4e11-4492-9f85-05a8b39d3522` has 100% traffic. Build detail confirms `npm run build:staging` then `npx wrangler deploy`. |
| Documentation/tooling build | Pass | Follow-up commit `9616370` also built successfully; Worker version `aa385132-c3a6-47a3-827a-26d808710258` has 100% traffic with the same application code. |
| Fallback-copy alignment build | Pass | Commit `58c8644` built successfully as Worker version `67aea95d-5b30-4e13-a87a-40608413b66d` at 100%. The compiled fallback descriptions now match the active, owner-published general service copy; R2 revision did not change. |
| Active Race Control coordinator | Pass | `xerom-race-control-coordinator` deployed version `b58e44ef-0a75-428b-ae58-854311239fd9` with the 15-minute no-show guard and private config R2 binding. Default `coordinator:deploy` now targets this Worker; the older booking coordinator has an explicit separate script. |
| Baseline config publication | Pass | Owner-only Race Control saved and published revision `rev-publish_02672e14d6aa2f36126f86035e40a3f06e0be7854d0aaf4a`. Impact review checked four future Calendar events and found no conflicts. No Calendar event was modified. An unlinked draft Regular Rig 04 was retired to match the confirmed three-rig inventory; no new Calendar was created. |
| Active public configuration | Pass | `/api/public-config` returns that revision with `compiledFallback: false`, rates RM20/RM30/RM18, zero active offers, rolling 4,320-minute horizon, 30/60/90/120-minute durations, and capacities 3/1/2. The public projection contains no Calendar references. |
| Deployed route and security smoke | Pass | `/`, `/book`, `/pricing`, `/visit`, `/booking-policy`, `/privacy`, `/robots.txt` and live availability returned 200. `/book` contains the hostname-scoped Turnstile widget and policy/privacy links; pricing contains no compare-at price markup; the temporary host remains noindex and `Disallow: /`. Unauthenticated `/race-control`, its schedule, and `/api/admin/config/draft` returned 302 to Access. |
| Live availability | Pass | Read-only Pro Sim 60-minute availability for 2026-09-25 returned HTTP 200, `mode: live`, 21 slots and the active configuration revision. |

Deployment note: the generic coordinator deploy command initially targeted the unbound legacy `xerom-booking-coordinator` Worker, version `b10d180a-27f3-4525-8c5f-11b191e4c950`; no website binding points to it. The active `xerom-race-control-coordinator` was then deployed and verified separately. No booking or Calendar event was created during either deploy.

## Client-owned staging rebuild — 2026-09-24

Environment: the transferred repository checked out locally and pointed at `xerombookings-dev/xerom-website`; Cloudflare account owned by the client; Google Calendar project and calendars owned by the client. Temporary public URL: `https://xerom-website.xerombookings.workers.dev`.

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub access | Pass | `git push --dry-run origin main` reached the transferred repository; Cloudflare’s GitHub App is installed for only `xerombookings-dev/xerom-website`. |
| Workers Builds | Pass | Cloudflare built commits `e51d513`, `4e5a9f9`, `fdde194`, and `e4eefef` from `xerombookings-dev/xerom-website` on `main`. `npm run build:staging` and `npx wrangler deploy` completed; the fourth build deployed Worker version `9b17b63b-4ed1-415b-a571-f6e2bd0b877d` at 100% traffic. Its log confirms the Durable Object, both R2 buckets, all five rate limits, `BOOKING_MODE=live`, and assets. |
| Cloudflare identity | Pass | `wrangler whoami` identified the client Cloudflare account. |
| Coordinator | Pass | `xerom-race-control-coordinator` deployed with SQLite Durable Object and private R2 config binding. |
| Website | Pass | `xerom-website` deployed at the temporary workers.dev host; homepage, booking, and all public routes rendered. The final smoke check used Worker version `9b17b63b-4ed1-415b-a571-f6e2bd0b877d`. |
| Staging indexing | Pass | Homepage canonical resolves to the workers.dev URL; `meta[name=robots]` is `noindex, nofollow`; `/robots.txt` returns `Disallow: /`. |
| Private R2 storage | Pass | Both private APAC buckets have deployed bindings. Put/get/delete probes passed in both and were removed. No active/draft configuration or media was published. |
| Owner protection | Pass | Cloudflare Access redirects unauthenticated `/race-control`, `/race-control/*`, and `/api/admin/*` to the owner policy. Authenticated Safari owner session loaded the live schedule. `GET /api/admin/config/draft` returned the compiled `seed-draft-v2` fallback. |
| Google Calendar identity | Pass | Client-owned service account authenticated to Calendar API. Seven client-owned private calendars are writer-accessible to it, listed in `Asia/Kuala_Lumpur`, and verified by live reads. Calendar IDs remain only in Worker secrets. |
| Live availability | Pass | Public booking flow returned live Regular, Pro, and PS5 availability from Calendar: 3/3 Regular, 1/1 Pro, and 2/2 PS5 capacity at tested times. Both current-day and next-day ranges loaded successfully. |
| Turnstile | Pass | Managed widget is hostname-scoped to the temporary workers.dev host. Safari completed the human check; live booking submission passed server-side Siteverify. The first unused widget whose secret appeared in CLI output was deleted. |
| Worker rate limits | Pass | Wrangler deployment lists all five bindings: availability 120/min, booking 10/min, owner read 60/min, owner mutation 60/min, and uploads 10/min. |
| Live final-resource race | Pass | Two simultaneous Pro Sim requests for Fri 25 Sep 2026, 11:30 PM MYT produced one confirmation and one “slot was just taken” response. The single winner event was deleted; follow-up Calendar search found no matching test event and FreeBusy returned zero busy intervals. |
| Responsive homepage | Pass | Remote `tests/e2e/visual.spec.ts` passed at 375, 390, 430, 768, 1024, and 1440 CSS px. Screenshots were visually inspected; generated files were restored to the repository’s tracked baseline. |
| Local checks | Pass | `npm run check`: 0 errors/warnings/hints; `npm test -- --run`: 126/126; `npm run build:staging` with the real staging site key; Wrangler website dry-run included all five Rate Limiting bindings. |
| Post-build smoke check | Pass | Homepage, `/book`, and `/robots.txt` returned 200; the booking page includes the managed Turnstile widget and robots disallows crawling. Read-only Pro availability returned 21 slots in live mode. Unauthenticated requests to the bare Race Control route, its nested routes, and owner API all redirected to Access; authenticated Safari loaded the live Calendar schedule. |

Known remaining launch gates: add the owner’s final canonical domain to DNS and Turnstile, verify `/sitemap.xml` and redirects after domain cutover, complete unresolved owner content items, and test reviewed R2 publication/rollback. The temporary Worker is live against the production-named calendars but remains noindex. The IAB browser logged Cloudflare Turnstile `%c%d ... NaN` diagnostics during widget initialization/expiry; real Safari rendered the widget and live server-side verification passed. Rate limit thresholds were not load-tested.

## Private R2 binding checkpoint — 2026-09-22

- Configured private Worker bindings for `xerom-race-control-config` and `xerom-race-control-media`; no `r2.dev`, custom domain or CORS exposure.
- Verified the rebuilt Astro Worker config contains both bindings and Wrangler dry-run accepts the generated deployment configuration.
- `npm run check` passes with no diagnostics; `npm test` passes 104/104; `npm run build:staging` passes.
- R2 was enabled and both Standard-class buckets were created with the APAC location hint. Remote put/get/delete probes passed in both buckets; cleanup was verified and both buckets remain empty.
- `r2.dev` reports `enabled: false` for both buckets, each custom-domain list is empty, and no browser CORS was configured.
- Website Worker version `e7a0627b-1bb1-4db4-ad6f-5dc846d506c5` deployed with both bindings. `/`, `/pricing`, and invalid-media fallback checks returned 200, 200, and 404 respectively; compiled pricing and hero fallback remain active.
- No `active.json`, draft, revision, media asset, booking, or Calendar event was created. Owner draft/media writes still require authenticated Race Control; publication remains blocked by the future-booking impact scan.

## Booking UI and coordinator compatibility — 2026-09-22

- Invoked the Impeccable layout process and replaced the desktop two-column time list with a compact 4/3/1-column availability board at desktop/tablet/phone widths.
- Fixed the deployed website/coordinator schema mismatch that rejected 90-minute bookings and optional email as `Invalid booking command.` Coordinator version `53e09b35-3a7b-41aa-ab87-c2e2b8afefea` and website version `e9dde038-aaa3-4e60-94b2-73fec8a07c5a` now share commit `5394e55` contracts.
- Added stale-selection invalidation for date, duration, and resource changes. Unavailable slots cannot enable continuation.
- `npm run check` passes with no diagnostics; `npm test` passes 104/104; public-site Playwright passes 33 with 27 intentional project skips across all six widths.
- Live read-only availability matrix passed 16/16 combinations: Regular, Pro, PS5, and mixed resources across 30/60/90/120 minutes. Every response was HTTP 200, exposed all resource capacities, and returned intervals matching the requested duration.
- No booking POST was sent and no Google Calendar event was created or changed during this verification.

## Website upgrade implementation checkpoint — 2026-09-22

Environment: local Astro/Cloudflare development, mock public booking API, no R2 binding, no deployment and no Calendar mutation.

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Astro/TypeScript/lint diagnostics | Pass | `npm run check`: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 hints across 121 files |
| Unit/contract tests | Pass | `npm test`: 92/92 across 21 files, including all durations, CSV escaping, image validation, rate-limit adapter and exactly-one-winner serialization |
| Production build | Pass | `npm run build`: Cloudflare server build completed |
| Media manifest | Pass | `npm run assets:verify`: 21/21 derivatives |
| Coordinator compile | Pass | `npx wrangler deploy --dry-run --config coordinator/wrangler.jsonc` |
| Diff hygiene | Pass | `git diff --check` returned no findings |
| Full responsive E2E | Pass | `npx playwright test --workers=1`: 69 passed, 33 intentional viewport/project skips at 375, 390, 430, 768, 1024 and 1440 |
| Production availability UI | Pass locally | Today auto-load, approved single-row indicators, mixed resources, accessible names and no 375px overflow are asserted |
| Customer confirmation | Pass locally | Optional email, controllers, resource summary, booking success independent of WhatsApp and fallback CTA are asserted |
| Race Control settings/publishing | Pass locally at code boundary | Editors, redacted seed, combined filters, CSV download contract, hero requirements and no overflow pass all widths |
| Impeccable detector | Advisory | Existing shared CSS type/color ramp findings and old side-tab declarations remain; shipped active-nav override is 1px. No new blocking detector category. |

The first full E2E pass found 13px horizontal overflow on the Publishing page at 768px. The uploader now collapses to one column at 900px and constrains the file input; a focused rerun and the subsequent full run pass.

Not marked complete externally: live R2 draft/media writes, impact-scan publication, Calendar provisioning, configured rate-limit bindings, uploaded hero cutover, enriched protected live-inspector selection, production Turnstile and deployed-origin verification. No external account or business-data mutation occurred.

## Website upgrade mockup checkpoint — 2026-09-22

Scope verified at this checkpoint: canonical config/booking changes, homepage navigation/order/placeholders, booking Setup controls, Race Control manual-booking field parity, and the standalone availability-indicator mockup. The production availability indicator, automatic availability load, downstream customer/Race Control/settings/publishing work, external services, and deployment were not exercised and are not claimed complete.

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Astro/TypeScript diagnostics | Pass | `npm run check`: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 hints across 112 files |
| Unit/contract tests | Pass | `npm test`: 81/81 across 18 files |
| Production build | Pass | `npm run build`: Cloudflare server build completed |
| Targeted responsive E2E | Pass | `npx playwright test tests/e2e/site.spec.ts tests/e2e/race-control.spec.ts --workers=1`: 49 passed, 23 intentional responsive skips across 375, 390, 430, 768, 1024 and 1440 widths |
| Homepage/placeholder routes | Pass | E2E covered `/`, `/events`, `/whats-new`, `/membership`, existing core routes, broken images, console failures and overflow |
| Booking Setup | Pass | E2E covered four durations, maximum warning, PS5 controller reveal and 0–6 choices at 375px; happy path passed all six widths |
| Availability mockup | Awaiting owner approval | `docs/mockups/availability-indicators.html`; captures at `.impeccable/review/availability-mockup/desktop.png` and `mobile.png` |
| Impeccable detector | Degraded/advisory | Optional parser modules unavailable, so regex fallback undercounted findings. New mockup Arial warning was removed. Existing shared CSS ramp advisories and the brief-required membership pill remain documented, not represented as a clean detector pass. |

No Cloudflare account/configuration change, R2 activation, deployment, Google Calendar write, Calendar deletion, or production mutation occurred in this checkpoint.

## Merge-hardening verification — 2026-09-19 (in progress)

Initial merge audit against freshly fetched `origin/main`: feature branch was 0 behind / 55 commits ahead. Existing checks passed: Astro diagnostics 0, Vitest 68/68, production build, media manifest, generated Worker type freshness, website dry-run, coordinator dry-run, and six-width Playwright (55 passed with 23 intentional viewport-specific skips). `git diff --check` exposed committed trailing whitespace. Read-only Cloudflare inspection confirmed the latest branch build for `1a4104f` succeeded, production remained on version `f3cefffa`, the active website Durable Object binding already targeted `xerom-race-control-coordinator`, coordinator version `e5f71ac7` was at 100%, and coordinator logs/traces were enabled. Production and branch availability returned live `200`; branch Race Control redirected to Access; the coordinator public entry point returned `404`. No external writes were performed.

The hardening implementation addresses the audit blockers with reusable operating-window validation, all-day event preservation, server lifecycle guards, ETag compensation, durable recovery fences, exact fence-aware public/final availability, ambiguous-Google-response handling, and a serialized per-instance mutation queue. Final local verification passed: Astro diagnostics 0; Vitest 76/76; media verification; production build; generated Worker type check; `git diff --check`; website dry-run; coordinator dry-run; and six-width Playwright with 55 passed / 23 intentional responsive skips. The first browser attempt used a stale 31-minute Astro process and every page returned HTTP 500 for a missing Vite optimized SSR module; after a clean server restart and verified `200`, the full rerun passed. Rate limiting is intentionally deferred until after the client test/demo and is tracked as a high-priority launch TODO.

After push of `b6e9ad0`, the branch website build began using the new fail-closed recovery-fence request while the separately deployed coordinator was still on the prior version. The branch `/api/availability` returned the expected HTTP 503 compatibility failure. After owner-approved Wrangler OAuth, coordinator version `1094b087-ac6e-47d1-ac88-92099c497211` deployed at 100% with the recovery-fence contract. Branch availability then returned live HTTP 200 with current Google Calendar capacities; the coordinator public endpoint remained HTTP 404. No Calendar event was created or changed by these smoke checks.

Last updated: 2026-09-15

## Current result

The client-demo Worker is live on its temporary `workers.dev` hostname with Google Calendar as the booking record, a serialized coordinator Durable Object, and Cloudflare's documented always-pass Turnstile test pair. Live availability, event creation/rollback, idempotent replay, and the final-resource race all pass. Replace the test Turnstile values and complete the remaining owner/content/security gates before public launch.

## Automated checks

| Filled-control contrast | Pass | Action Racing Red `#d12a25` with white measures 5.16:1; hover `#b92320` measures 6.32:1 |

## Live integration checks (2026-09-13)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Google service-account auth + FreeBusy | Pass | Deployed `/api/availability` returned HTTP 200 with `mode: live` and expected Regular/Pro/PS5 capacities for a future Malaysia-local date |
| Private Calendar event creation + cleanup | Pass | Temporary Regular booking returned HTTP 201 (`RM20`); event was found by booking ID and deleted; follow-up availability restored full capacity |
| Idempotency replay | Pass | Same PS5 request returned HTTP 201 then HTTP 200 with `replayed: true`; the single event was deleted afterward |
| Final-resource concurrency | Pass | Two simultaneous Pro requests returned exactly one HTTP 201 and one HTTP 409; the winning event was deleted afterward |
| Turnstile server verification | Pass (demo keys) | Cloudflare documented always-pass site/secret pair accepted `XXXX.DUMMY.TOKEN.XXXX`; replace before launch |
| Coordinator deployment | Pass | `xerom-booking-coordinator` deployed at its `workers.dev` endpoint; logs captured the prior 403 diagnosis and are now enabled |
| Public Worker binding | Pass | Root deployment log shows `env.BOOKING_COORDINATOR (BookingCoordinator, defined in xerom-booking-coordinator)` |
| Temporary-event cleanup | Pass | Calendar API audit query found zero remaining smoke/race/idempotency/diagnostic events |

These items must not be marked passed until the required accounts, calendars, secrets, and confirmed business content are available.

## Homepage UI/UX upgrade verification (2026-09-15)

The cinematic homepage upgrade is implemented on `exp/homepage-cinematic-v1`. Its hero headline is exactly `Race Together`; Klang appears only as separate location information. The booking API, coordinator, form components, and booking configuration are unchanged from baseline `4e9787c`.

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Astro/TypeScript diagnostics | Pass | `npm run check`: 0 errors and 0 warnings in project sources; two hints originate in the pre-existing untracked `hive-v3-installation` directory |
| Booking unit tests | Pass | `npm test`: 15/15 passed |
| Production build | Pass | `npm run build`: Cloudflare server output generated successfully |
| Media manifest | Pass | `npm run assets:verify`: 21/21 derivatives verified, including six responsive hero AVIF/WebP assets |
| Responsive and booking E2E | Pass | `npm run test:e2e`: 36 passed, 12 intentional project-specific skips at 375, 390, 430, 768, 1024, and 1440 CSS pixels |
| Headline contract | Pass | Accessible name and visible text both assert exactly `Race Together`; `In Klang` is absent from the heading |
| Accessibility regression | Pass | Keyboard-contained menu, Escape dismissal/focus return, visible 3px focus, 44px mobile Book target, no mobile overflow, 200%-equivalent reflow, reduced-motion behavior, and semantic booking confirmation assertions pass |
| Browser/runtime regression | Pass | Core routes have no browser console errors, failed requests, broken images, or missing favicon/manifest assets in the automated pass |
| Booking UI regression | Pass | Complete setup, slot, customer details, confirmation, booking ID, total, and WhatsApp journey passes with only the final local POST mocked; no booking production code was edited |
| Booking invariants | Pass (unchanged evidence) | Protected booking diff from baseline is empty; the 2026-09-13 live idempotency, rollback cleanup, and exactly-one-winner concurrency evidence above remains applicable |
| Local production-preview Lighthouse | Pass with LCP note | Performance 93, Accessibility 100, Best Practices 100, SEO 100; FCP 2.0s, LCP 2.9–3.0s, CLS 0.018, TBT 0ms. The local LCP is 0.4–0.5s above the 2.5s stretch target and requires deployed-origin remeasurement |
| Responsive screenshots | Pass | Before and after captures are stored under `.impeccable/review/homepage-upgrade/` for all six required widths |

The only non-owner homepage media remains `social-group-hero.placeholder-ai.*`. It is explicitly identified in its filename, manifest provenance, source comments, and alternative text, and must be replaced with an owner-approved social venue photograph before production sign-off.

The branch was pushed to `origin/exp/homepage-cinematic-v1`. A 2026-09-15 `wrangler deploy` attempt stopped before deployment because this non-interactive session has no `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`; therefore deployed-origin screenshots, Lighthouse, and live-stage smoke checks remain unrun and are not marked passing. The existing staging Worker was not changed. One warm full E2E run completed every functional assertion and encountered a transient OneDrive lock only while overwriting the final 1440px PNG; the isolated screenshot case passed immediately afterward, giving 36 passed checks and 12 intentional skips across the combined final run.

### Owner revision: Choose Your Setup restoration

The redundant More Than Racing gallery was replaced with the previous Choose Your Setup split section only. The restored block uses the Pro Rig image, the three confirmed resource facts, and a Compare Experiences link to `/experiences`. Astro diagnostics, all 15 booking unit tests, and the production build pass. The section contract and no-overflow checks pass at all six required widths; refreshed 390px and 1440px captures are stored under `.impeccable/review/homepage-upgrade/setup-restored/`.

### Owner revision: phone experience-dock removal

The Race / Play / Refuel dock is hidden at the 560px phone breakpoint to remove duplication with Pick Your Pace, while remaining visible at 768px and all desktop widths. Automated assertions verify the breakpoint behavior and document-width overflow at all six required viewports. No markup, service route, or booking behavior was removed; phone users retain the four Pick Your Pace cards and their direct service links.

Verification passed with 0 Astro errors, 15/15 unit tests, a successful production build, and 12/12 breakpoint/overflow/core-route checks. The full functional browser suite passed every case across the combined final run: one first-request local booking timeout at 375px passed on immediate focused rerun. Representative phone, tablet, and desktop captures are stored under `.impeccable/review/homepage-upgrade/mobile-dock-hidden/`.

## Race Control RC-00 through contract/security shell checkpoint (2026-09-16)

Environment: local repository on macOS, Astro development fixture mode, no R2 binding, no owner OAuth, no Google mutation, no deployment.

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Astro/TypeScript diagnostics | Pass | `npm run check`: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 hints across 87 files before the final browser-only test addition |
| Full unit/contract suite | Pass | `npm test`: 51/51 tests across 13 files |
| Production build | Pass | `npm run build`: Cloudflare server output completed successfully |
| Impeccable detector | Pass | `detect.mjs --json` returned `[]` after the first UI implementation; subsequent cleanup removed the external font import, glyph icons, invalid logo path and incomplete ARIA grid claim |
| Race Control contract tests | Pass | Config schema/seed/public allowlist, stale draft, conditional activation, owner Access allowlist/CSRF, lost-create reconciliation, operation replay/fences, Google fail-closed behavior and runtime pricing all pass locally |
| Responsive Race Control browser suite | Pass after one fix round | `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4321 npx playwright test tests/e2e/race-control.spec.ts --workers=1`: 12/12 passed across 375, 390, 430, 768, 1024 and 1440 CSS-pixel widths. Initial run found fixture-placeholder assertion misuse and real overflow at 768/1024; both were fixed before rerun |
| Browser errors and failed requests | Pass | Race Control schedule test asserts no console errors or failed requests at all six widths |
| Private/draft labelling | Pass | Browser assertions verify the owner surface is `noindex`, visibly marked demo-only, settings remain `Not published`, and no fixture calendar reference reaches rendered output |
| Screenshot evidence | Pass | `.impeccable/review/race-control/{mobile-375,mobile-390,mobile-430,tablet-768,desktop-1024,desktop-1440}.png` |
| Independent shell finish review | Ship | First review returned five material fixes; toolbar, tablet overlay, chronological agenda, contextual Details labels and mobile-nav cue were implemented. Second-pass verdict scored all five resolved |
| Coordinator bundle dry run | Pass | `WRANGLER_LOG_PATH=/tmp/xerom-coordinator-dry-run.log npx wrangler deploy --dry-run --config coordinator/wrangler.jsonc` completed; no deployment occurred |

Not run and not passed: live R2 conditional writes, Access JWT verification against the actual team domain, Google owner OAuth, Calendar create/share/probe/delete, real coordinator restart/alarm recovery, config publication, front-desk booking mutations, resource provisioning, media upload, public-runtime cutover, deployed security/rate-limit checks, or production deployment. The dashboard remains a clearly labelled synthetic shell; it does not satisfy the complete Race Control definition of done.

## Race Control branch sync checkpoint (2026-09-16)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Feature branch | Pass | `codex/race-control-working`, baseline commit `5e726da`, Calendar sync commit `d0ce491`, pushed to `origin` |
| Cloudflare branch build | Pass | Build `bb46454c` for `d0ce491` reported Success and branch alias versions are separate from the public deployment |
| Shared Calendar schedule contract | Pass locally | Paginated event-list adapter test added; schedule endpoint reads resource/control calendars server-side and keeps IDs out of the response |
| Shared booking command | Implemented, not externally exercised | Owner booking endpoint delegates to the same named coordinator used by the public site; no live event was created as a test |
| Local UI regression | Pass | `npm run check` clean, Calendar adapter tests 4/4, six-width Race Control Playwright suite 12/12 with runtime reads disabled in local fixture mode |

Remaining before web verification: Cloudflare Access has no Zero Trust organization, so owner endpoints must remain deny-by-default. Owner confirmation is required before creating the organization and email-OTP policy. The branch build is not a production deployment.

## Access-protected branch preview checkpoint (2026-09-16)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Zero Trust Free activation | Pass | Cloudflare confirmation showed purchase complete, Zero Trust Free, and $0 due today after owner-authorized terms/card step |
| Access application | Pass | `Xerom Race Control Branch Preview`, app ID `6cbb336f-5aff-4659-b1e2-97982924b3aa`; destinations are branch `/race-control/*` and `/api/admin/*` only |
| Owner policy | Pass | Reusable policy `Xerom Race Control Owner`, policy ID `57014aed-34b5-4b9b-967a-bce1e926400f`, one owner email rule |
| Worker Access variables | Pass | `ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` and `ACCESS_AUDIENCE` variables plus encrypted `OWNER_EMAILS` visible in Worker settings; secrets remain out of Git |
| R2 capability check | Blocked | `npx wrangler r2 bucket list` returned Cloudflare code 10042: enable R2 through Dashboard; no bucket/binding was created |

The branch preview has fresh alias versions (latest observed version number 60) and still needs owner OTP login plus a non-destructive schedule-read check. Saving Access variables through the Worker dashboard also created production deployment `f3cefffa` at 100% traffic from the pre-existing production code; no Race Control branch code was promoted and no Google Calendar mutation was performed here.

## Front-desk action implementation checkpoint (2026-09-16)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Owner booking creation route | Implemented | `POST /api/admin/bookings` validates the existing booking schema and delegates to the same global coordinator/calendar path as public bookings |
| Group lifecycle action route | Implemented locally | `POST /api/admin/bookings/:id/actions` supports check-in, complete, no-show and cancel; owner auth/CSRF and coordinator binding gates apply |
| Calendar mutation safety | Adapter-tested | ETag `If-Match`, 412 conflict handling, private booking lookup and transparent cancellation are covered by local mocked Calendar tests |
| Local contract/build verification | Pass | `npm run check`, Race Control tests 24/24, and `npm run build` |

Not yet run: live owner OTP login, live schedule listing, live owner booking/action, exact Calendar event cleanup, extension/reschedule/maintenance/closure operations, R2 publication, or production traffic changes. These require the protected branch preview and explicit test-booking cleanup authorization.

## Extension/reschedule implementation checkpoint (2026-09-16)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Same-resource reschedule | Implemented locally | Coordinator finds the complete booking group by private booking ID, rejects resource-set changes, excludes verified current event IDs from conflict checks, and patches all events with ETags |
| Extension | Implemented locally | Coordinator checks the added interval on every linked resource and patches all ends only after the interval is clear; response flags explicit price review |
| Coordinator dry run | Pass | `WRANGLER_LOG_PATH=/tmp/xerom-coordinator-dry-run.log npx wrangler deploy --dry-run --config coordinator/wrangler.jsonc` completed with the existing SQLite DO binding |
| Local verification | Pass | Astro check clean, Race Control tests 24/24, production build passed |

Not yet run against Google: any extension/reschedule or lifecycle action, partial-update compensation/reconciliation, maintenance/closure, settings publication, R2, or production traffic. Current implementation deliberately does not silently move resources or repackage historical prices.

## Maintenance/closure implementation checkpoint (2026-09-16)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Maintenance block contract | Implemented locally | Strict block schema requires interval, reason, resource IDs and idempotency key |
| Venue closure contract | Implemented locally | Venue closures must target Booking Control; created blocks remain opaque and server-authoritative |
| Block creation safety | Implemented locally | Coordinator preflights every target Calendar, creates deterministic events, records the attempt, and best-effort rolls back partial creation |
| UI regression | Pass | Local Race Control Playwright suite 12/12 across all required widths; new block form is keyboard-labelled and no-overflow |

No live maintenance/closure block was created. Real conflict review, compensation fencing, and Calendar mutation verification remain open.

## Configuration review boundary checkpoint (2026-09-16)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Draft review endpoint | Implemented locally | `POST /api/admin/config/review` reads the conditional draft, verifies the server-calculated hash, issues a five-minute HMAC token and returns explicit impact-scan blocking state |
| Review token binding | Pass | Local tests 2/2 cover draft hash/base revision binding and missing-secret failure |
| Safe publication boundary | Pass | No publish action is exposed until complete future-booking impact review and R2 activation prerequisites exist |

The review endpoint has not been run with live R2 or Google data and intentionally cannot authorize publication while those gates are absent.

## Complete configuration impact scan checkpoint (2026-09-22)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Complete Calendar inventory | Implemented | Review paginates all configured resource and Booking Control calendars without a silent future cutoff |
| Recurring events | Fail closed | Finite series expand through the Calendar instances API; open-ended series remain explicit blocking conflicts |
| Availability-impact validation | Pass locally | Hours, overnight windows, exceptions, buffers, retired/disabled resources and removed durations are checked against future events |
| Manual/unknown blocks | Fail closed | Unrecognized future busy events are reported for explicit owner resolution rather than assumed safe |
| Irrelevant changes | Pass locally | Pricing/content-only drafts skip Calendar impact scanning and do not invalidate locked historical prices |
| Local verification | Pass | `npm run check`: clean; `npm test -- --run`: 107/107 tests |

The scan is read-only. No booking, Calendar event, R2 active pointer or configuration revision was created. Authenticated live review remains to be exercised by the owner; publication/rollback remains a separate unimplemented mutation path.

## Private calendar provisioning checkpoint (2026-09-23)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Provisioning route | Implemented | `POST /api/admin/resources/provision` with owner auth, CSRF, bounded body and expected-ETag guard |
| Idempotent creation | Pass locally | Deterministic `xerom-resource:<resourceId>` description marker; reconcile-by-listing instead of blind retry; multiple matches fail closed |
| Write verification | Pass locally | Private probe event created and removed; 409 treated as existing, 403 fails closed |
| Identifier privacy | Pass locally | Owner projection returns `calendarRef: null` with `calendarManaged`; IDs never reach the browser |
| Optional venue sharing | Pass locally | `VENUE_GOOGLE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` grants owner ACL; already-shared 409 treated as success; sharing failure is non-fatal |
| Tests | Pass | 123/123 unit/contract, including create/uncertain/marker-reconcile/probe/share coverage |
| Type/build | Pass | `npm run check` clean; staging build passed |
| Deploy | Pass | `xerom-website` version `c1a6698a-7ee5-45a4-8e7d-46b2a4069319` |

No calendar was created during verification; the Google calls were exercised only through mocked adapters. Provisioning has not yet been run against live Google from an authenticated owner session.

### Defect: write verification always failed (2026-09-23)

First live attempt returned "The new calendar could not be verified for writes." Cause: the probe event ID `xerom-provision-probe` contains `x` and hyphens, but Google requires base32hex (`a-v`, `0-9`), so every probe insert returned 400. Booking event IDs were unaffected because they already use hex digests. Fix: the probe ID is now a deterministic 32-character hex digest of the resource ID, passed into `verifyCalendarWriteWithToken`. Tests updated (124/124). Deployed as `xerom-website` version `7ebb2220-e3cc-49ab-87a2-11bf5fce128f`, superseding `c1a6698a`.

## Publication-blocking review incident (2026-09-23)

Symptom: the owner could not publish. Production logs showed `POST /api/admin/config/review` returned 503 twice (and 200 twice), `PUT /api/admin/config/draft` returned 503 twice, and the coordinator received **zero** `activate-config` commands — so publication never started and the Publish button never enabled.

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Root-cause scope | Identified | Review ran the new full Calendar scan; the inventory listed each calendar with no time bound, walking full history and expanding recurrences (CPU/memory and Google quota risk) |
| Bounded inventory | Fixed | `singleEvents=true` with `timeMin` (events ending after the review instant) and no full-history walk |
| Open-ended series | Preserved | Series without `UNTIL`/`COUNT` are fetched by master ID and returned as explicit blocking conflicts |
| Diagnostics | Added | Review/publish log an identifier-free cause; the owner sees a safe reason instead of a generic message |
| Tests | Pass | 119/119 unit/contract, including updated bounded-inventory coverage |
| Type/build | Pass | `npm run check` clean; staging build passed |
| Deploy | Pass | `xerom-website` version `78940cac-8abd-4bab-97d7-1b0ae38f0ef1` |

No configuration was published; `active.json` and immutable revisions remain absent and no Calendar event changed. The owner must retry **Review changes**, then **Publish reviewed draft**, and the resulting logs will confirm either success or a precise remaining conflict.

## Production deployment checkpoint (2026-09-23)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Coordinator deployed first | Pass | `xerom-race-control-coordinator` version `41465367-fa6f-4ad9-9882-a34ac334c90b` at 100% |
| Website deployed | Pass | `xerom-website` version `2a1f2aaa-1937-4166-95c9-fc1e6e7e7990`, then secret version `65bf1e62-013d-4d3b-887f-850ee7714425` |
| Shared review secret | Pass | Both Workers list `RACE_CONTROL_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`; value rotated once, never printed, temp file deleted |
| Public homepage | Pass | `GET /` -> 200 |
| Public config read | Pass | `GET /api/public-config` -> 200, `revisionId` `seed-draft-v2` (compiled bootstrap) |
| Owner route protection | Pass | `/race-control/schedule` and `/api/admin/config/draft` -> 302 to Cloudflare Access |
| Coordinator public surface | Pass | Coordinator root -> 404; the Durable Object is reachable only through the website binding |
| Live availability | Pass | `GET /api/availability` -> 200, `mode: "live"`, configured capacities |
| Config bucket unpublished | Pass | `active.json` and `draft.json` return "The specified key does not exist." |

No configuration revision was published, no `active.json` was created, no media object was added, and no Google Calendar event was created or changed. The authenticated owner review/publish flow is the next unverified gate.

## Serialized configuration publication checkpoint (2026-09-23)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Review binding | Pass locally | Signed review token, draft ETag/hash and active base revision are revalidated inside coordinator serialization; tampering, expiry and stale-state tests pass |
| Fresh Calendar scan | Pass locally | Publication invokes the same complete fail-closed impact scan after entering the venue mutation queue; a newly discovered conflict prevents intent/revision/pointer writes |
| Immutable activation | Pass locally | Durable intent precedes immutable revision creation; `active.json` uses an expected ETag and is read back after replacement |
| Replay/recovery | Pass locally | Tests cover failure before revision creation, identical immutable-write recovery, pointer-swap loss and lost response after activation without duplicate publication |
| Rollback | Pass locally | Previous settings become a new private draft; current Calendar mappings are preserved, missing historical mappings remain unprovisioned, and normal review/publication is mandatory |
| Runtime consistency | Pass locally | Public SSR surfaces share one revision per response; availability and final booking creation reject an open page carrying a stale revision |
| Type/unit/build | Pass | `npm run check`: clean; `npm test -- --run`: 119/119; production and staging builds passed |
| Browser regression | Pass | Playwright at 375, 390, 430, 768, 1024 and 1440 CSS px: 70 passed, 38 intentional viewport-specific skips |
| Deploy packaging | Pass | Website and coordinator Wrangler dry runs include the private R2 bindings and complete successfully |

No owner publish/rollback request was sent. No production `active.json`, immutable config revision, media object, booking or Calendar mutation was created. Authenticated live review is still pending; first publication requires separate approval.

## Bounded owner booking search checkpoint (2026-09-16)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Search contract | Pass | Local booking-search tests validate reversed-date rejection, private booking grouping and separate manual blocks |
| Owner search route | Implemented locally | `GET /api/admin/bookings?from=&to=&query=` has bounded date inputs and no permanent customer directory |
| Bookings UI | Implemented locally | Date range/query form updates a semantic table from the route and retains labelled fixtures on unavailable integration |
| Responsive regression | Pass | Six-width Race Control browser suite 12/12 after clearing generated Vite cache; no source or production state was removed |

## Hours/resource safety rule checkpoint (2026-09-16)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Hours impact review rules | Pass | Tests block outside-proposed-hours events and open-ended recurring series for explicit owner review |
| Resource retirement guards | Pass | Tests allow retirement only after future capacity/recurrence is resolved |
| Permanent deletion guards | Pass | Tests require a retired, non-control, empty calendar and a fresh confirmation; nonempty history is blocked pending retention/export policy |

These rules are pure contract coverage only. No Calendar deletion, retirement, or hours publication was executed.

## Latest repository checkpoint (2026-09-16)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Astro diagnostics | Pass | `npm run check`: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 hints across 103 files |
| Full unit/contract suite | Pass | `npm test`: 60/60 tests across 16 files |
| Production build | Pass | `npm run build`: Cloudflare server output completed successfully |
| Working tree | Pass | `git diff --check` clean; latest feature-branch commit `2203d2a` pushed to origin |
| Branch access smoke | Pass | Read-only curl: `/race-control/schedule` returns Access 302; public `/` returns 200; no Calendar mutation |

The owner OTP/session and live authenticated schedule/booking checks remain unrun in this environment.

## Separate coordinator deployment checkpoint (2026-09-16)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Separate Worker deployment | Pass | `xerom-race-control-coordinator` deployed with SQLite Durable Object and observability; URL `https://xerom-race-control-coordinator.aaronbasil9400.workers.dev` |
| Google secret provisioning | Pass | `wrangler secret list --config coordinator/wrangler.race-control.jsonc` shows the private key, service-account email, six resource IDs and Booking Control ID; values were never printed or committed |
| Website feature-branch binding | Implemented | Feature `wrangler.jsonc` now names `xerom-race-control-coordinator`; generated `worker-configuration.d.ts` reflects that binding |
| Main-site preservation | Pass | `main` remains bound to `xerom-booking-coordinator`; no production Calendar/event mutation was performed |

The fresh feature-branch build and authenticated browser test are still pending. The one-time downloaded Google key file was removed after upload.

## Latest branch/browser verification checkpoint (2026-09-16)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Live-state UI correction | Pass | Commit `7249049` replaces the stale demo banner and synthetic inspector when the server-side Google/coordinator binding gate is present; local fixture mode remains unchanged |
| Feature branch sync | Pass | `codex/race-control-working` pushed to `origin`; latest observed Cloudflare branch alias version 68 |
| Local validation | Pass | `npm run check` clean; `npm test` 60/60; `npm run build` completed successfully |
| Responsive browser suite | Pass | Configured local Playwright run after clearing only generated Vite cache: 12/12 at 375, 390, 430, 768, 1024 and 1440 CSS px |
| Protected live browser read | Pass | In-app browser showed the Access-protected branch schedule, live shared-calendar agenda, live inspector-ready state and refresh timestamp; no customer details were recorded |
| Browser console health | Pass | Live branch and temporary public-home checks returned zero console errors; no failed request was observed in the live read |

No live mutation was submitted. Creating a synthetic booking would create real shared Calendar events and requires explicit action-time approval followed by cleanup. R2 remains disabled; settings/content publication and other production cutover gates are still open.

## Approved synthetic booking write/cleanup checkpoint (2026-09-16)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Owner booking creation | Pass | Protected branch form created one synthetic one-hour Regular 01 reservation through the separate coordinator and reported confirmation only after Calendar verification |
| Shared schedule sync | Pass | The new booking appeared in the live agenda immediately after creation; no production site or calendar was changed |
| Owner cancellation | Pass | Live Bookings search found the grouped record; owner-only Cancel action confirmed and marked the record `cancelled` while preserving its audit record |
| Availability release | Pass | Follow-up live schedule read for the tested date reported `No busy Calendar events for this business date.` |
| Post-change regression | Pass | `npm run check`, `npm test` 60/60, `npm run build`, and Playwright six-width suite 12/12 |

The synthetic customer name/phone/notes and booking identifier were not copied into documentation or analytics. No delete operation was performed; cancellation released availability while preserving the Calendar record. Further lifecycle actions, blocks, settings publication, R2, OAuth provisioning, recovery testing and production cutover remain open.

## Manual booking policy change checkpoint (2026-09-16)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Manual duration options | Pass | Branch browser form visibly exposes 30, 60 and 120 minutes |
| Manual start guidance | Pass | Branch browser form visibly states any minute within opening hours and no one-hour notice floor |
| Public policy separation | Pass | Public schema/API still accepts only 60/120; public availability remains hourly and one-hour notice |
| Server-side policy | Pass | Separate coordinator uses the owner/manual policy while retaining future-start, horizon, hours and Calendar conflict checks |
| Local validation | Pass | `npm run check` clean; `npm test` 64/64; `npm run build` passed; clean-server Playwright Race Control suite 12/12 |

This change was verified in the browser without creating a second live reservation. The earlier approved synthetic booking create/cancel test remains the live proof of the shared Calendar write path.

## Live schedule hardening checkpoint (2026-09-16)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Date-aware live heading | Pass | Protected branch renders the selected MYT business date; it no longer shows the hard-coded synthetic date |
| Date navigation | Pass | Browser Next moved to the following date and returned a live empty state; Today returned to the current date |
| Live-safe loading/error state | Pass | Synthetic timeline is hidden in live mode; empty and failure states do not claim availability |
| Service filtering | Pass | PS5 filter removed non-PS5 live events in the browser |
| Live inspector selection | Pass | Selecting a live event populated booking ID, status, time, resource and Calendar summary |
| Refresh control | Pass | Topbar refresh affordance is wired to the schedule refresh event |
| Regression | Pass | `npm run check`, `npm test` 64/64, `npm run build`, detector run, and clean-server Playwright 12/12 |

No new live booking or block was created for this checkpoint. The guide for client demos and owner operations is [RACE_CONTROL_USER_GUIDE.md](docs/agent/RACE_CONTROL_USER_GUIDE.md).

The Impeccable detector reported existing Race Control shell side-tab/advisory type/color findings in the shared stylesheet; the schedule changes introduced no new detector category. These are retained as a visual-system follow-up rather than blocking the functional schedule gate.

## Live inspector action checkpoint (2026-09-16)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Conditional lifecycle controls | Pass | Selecting a live confirmed booking visibly exposes Check in, Complete, No-show and Cancel; controls are hidden for non-active or unversioned blocks |
| Early release guard | Pass | Complete includes an explicit “Release remaining time” checkbox; no release is implicit |
| Legacy event compatibility | Pass | Missing `groupVersion` falls back to coordinator version 0; no action was sent during this verification |
| Action request safety | Pass locally | Owner API sends expected booking version, CSRF header and a new idempotency key; coordinator remains ETag-guarded |
| Regression | Pass | `npm run check`, `npm test` 64/64, `npm run build`, and clean-server Playwright 12/12 |

No live lifecycle mutation was submitted for this checkpoint. Reschedule/extension quote UI, full activity/audit rendering, recovery fencing and external failure-injection remain open.

## Inspector compatibility checkpoint (2026-09-16)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Legacy booking version fallback | Pass | Existing live booking without an explicit `groupVersion` showed valid lifecycle controls using version 0 |
| Selection consistency | Pass | Selecting a live booking, then moving to the next date, cleared the inspector before the new live read completed |
| Empty-date state | Pass | The next date rendered `No busy Calendar events for this business date.` with no stale selection |
| Console health | Pass | Zero browser console errors after live selection/navigation |

No lifecycle mutation was submitted. This compatibility fix is commit `2beaa72`; the separate coordinator remains deployed and production remains untouched.

The post-action-slice clean-server Playwright rerun also passed 12/12 after clearing only the generated Vite SSR cache; generated review screenshots were restored and are not part of the branch change.

## Coordinator deployment boundary (2026-09-16)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Website branch deployment | Pass | Branch alias builds are current and Access-protected |
| Existing coordinator compatibility | Preserved | Main website remains bound to `script_name: xerom-booking-coordinator`; current production coordinator was not changed |
| Separate coordinator commands | Deployed, live verification pending | `xerom-race-control-coordinator` has its own SQLite DO, latest coordinator code, observability, and encrypted Google secrets; owner-authenticated action tests have not yet run |

Live lifecycle/extension/reschedule/maintenance/closure/block commands can now be tested only after owner Access login on the branch preview. No test action has been submitted yet; preserve the main-site coordinator and clean up only an explicitly authorized test booking/block.

## Browser shared-calendar read checkpoint (2026-09-16)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Protected branch browser route | Pass | In-app browser loaded `/race-control/schedule` on the feature preview after the separate coordinator binding and Access variables were present |
| Shared Calendar read | Pass | Live agenda replaced fixtures with one existing private resource-calendar event and displayed the server refresh timestamp; no customer details were copied into this report |
| Live write test | Pending | Creating a browser test booking would create a real reservation event; it has not been submitted yet |

The browser session confirmed the shared-calendar connection state and live event list. Owner-authenticated mutation verification remains pending a clearly labelled test booking and cleanup.

## Live resource timeline chart checkpoint (2026-09-16)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Business-window contract | Pass | Schedule API now returns the selected business window derived from the confirmed MYT operating hours |
| Desktop chart data mapping | Pass | Each live Calendar resource renders its own row; event start/end map to proportional hour-axis positions and widths |
| Multiple-resource/group visibility | Pass | Linked events remain on their individual resource rows; lane assignment prevents visual overlap within a row |
| Block/open semantics | Pass | Control/maintenance events use blocked styling; resources without events remain visible as open rows |
| Mobile fallback | Pass | Narrow view keeps a chronological live agenda list with the same filtered event set |
| Filter/search/inspector continuity | Pass | Service/search filtering applies before both renders; selecting a chart/list event still updates the inspector |
| Regression | Pass | `npm run check`, `npm test` 64/64, `npm run build`, clean-server Playwright 12/12, detector run |

No new live reservation or block was created. The chart is a read-only rendering change over the existing Calendar response; production remains untouched.

## Manual booking error-flow checkpoint (2026-09-16)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Error diagnosis | Pass | The generic review message was traced to an admin 400 whose `fieldErrors` were not rendered by the client |
| Datetime normalization | Pass | Manual `datetime-local` values now safely receive one MYT offset regardless of whether seconds are present |
| Field-level feedback | Pass | API and form expose the exact rejected path/reason instead of only `Review the booking details.` |
| Success navigation | Pass | Confirmed manual creates dispatch a shared-schedule refresh and scroll to the live agenda |
| Regression | Pass | `npm run check`, `npm test` 64/64, `npm run build`, clean-server Playwright 12/12, live browser form read |

No live reservation was created for this fix. The approved earlier synthetic create/cancel test remains the live write proof.

## Live schedule polling checkpoint (2026-09-16)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Visible-tab polling | Pass | Protected preview refresh timestamp advanced from 6:24:44 PM to 6:24:59 PM without a page reload |
| Poll interval | Pass | Summary displays `15 sec` and the last successful MYT sync time |
| Focus/visibility behavior | Implemented | Browser code starts polling only for visible tabs, stops it when hidden, and immediately reads on visibility/focus return |
| Overlap safety | Pass by implementation | A concurrent refresh queues one follow-up read after the active request completes; date changes cannot render an older response over the newly selected date |
| Failure safety | Pass by implementation | Last successful chart remains stale context with no availability claim on poll failure |

No Calendar mutation was created for the polling check. The owner guide now documents the refresh behavior.

## Client-demo banner checkpoint (2026-09-16)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Live banner treatment | Pass | Amber live banners are neutral gray Broadcast panels; status text remains visible and truthful |
| Sync/draft treatment | Pass | Live Calendar sync is green; the live Draft surface badge uses neutral structural styling |
| Validation output treatment | Pass | Booking output is muted by default, coral for errors and green for successful confirmation |
| Deployed browser preview | Pass | Branch preview visually verified the neutral treatment with zero console errors |
| GitHub branch | Pass | Local HEAD `988d88b` matched `origin/codex-race-control-working` before this docs-only checkpoint |
| Regression | Pass | `npm run check`, `npm test` 64/64, `npm run build`, clean-server Playwright 12/12 |

No production code or Calendar state was changed. The attached screenshot was used only as a visual reference for the warning treatment.

## Compact timeline lanes and polling copy checkpoint (2026-09-16)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Sequential events keep one row lane | Pass | Three non-overlapping bookings on one resource resolve to lane `0`; the resource row stays at `3.6rem` |
| Same-resource collisions stack | Pass | Three overlapping same-hour intervals resolve to lanes `0`, `1`, and `2` |
| Adjacent events reuse a lane | Pass | An event ending exactly when the next begins remains in one lane |
| Same-hour group on separate resources | Pass | Each resource row independently resolves to one lane; a grouped booking does not increase either row height |
| Browser live data check | Pass | A fresh protected-preview load rendered Regular 01's three sequential blocks in one chart row and the same-time group on Regular 02 in its own row; no Calendar mutation was made |
| Background-poll copy | Pass | The fresh deployed preview performed its initial shared-Calendar read and subsequent 15-second refresh with no transient `Loading…` text; ARIA `busy` remains for assistive technology and error/empty states remain visible |
| Typecheck/unit/build | Pass | `npm run check` (0 errors/warnings/hints), `npm test` (68/68), `npm run build` (pass) |
| Playwright six-width suite | Environment blocked | Chromium was denied the macOS Mach-port rendezvous permission before any test page loaded; this is recorded as unrun, not a product failure |

The waste space came from sizing a resource row by **the number of events**, rather than the number of concurrent visual lanes. The implementation now uses a typed pure lane allocator with half-open intervals, so only genuine time overlap adds vertical space. The implementation and initial log are commit `16c64c5` on `origin/codex/race-control-working`. No live bookings, blocks, or calendar events were created, edited, or deleted.

## Collapsible Race Control navigation checkpoint (2026-09-17)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Desktop/tablet collapse | Pass | The header control collapses the 701px-and-up section navigation, updates its accessible label/expanded state, and gives the work area more than 90% of the shell width |
| Persistence and restore | Pass | The selected state is stored in local storage before navigation; reload remains collapsed and the same control restores the rail |
| Phone safety | Pass | At 375, 390 and 430px, a saved desktop collapse preference does not hide the horizontal navigation; the collapse control is intentionally unavailable |
| Responsive browser suite | Pass | Playwright: 18 passed, 6 intentional viewport-specific skips across 375, 390, 430, 768, 1024 and 1440px |
| Static verification | Pass | `npm run check` (0 errors/warnings/hints), `npm test` (68/68), `npm run build` (pass), clean diff |

The user-supplied sidebar patch was applied as a reviewed integration rather than verbatim: its desktop/tablet behavior was retained, but its collapse selector was scoped above the mobile breakpoint so a persisted preference cannot make phone navigation disappear. Generated Playwright screenshots were restored after verification. No Calendar or production state changed.

Cloudflare verification: the feature branch was uploaded as preview Worker version `98` under the `codex-race-control-working` alias at 2026-09-17 11:11:56 UTC. The production deployment list was inspected separately and was not changed. A new browser session reached the expected Cloudflare Access owner-login page; no login code was requested or submitted, so the protected remote visual read remains intentionally pending an authenticated owner session.

## Schedule polling interval update (2026-09-17)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Visible-tab interval | Pass | The shared Calendar polling timer and the live Last sync summary now use 60 seconds |
| Immediate reads preserved | Pass by implementation | Focus/visibility return, date changes, owner writes, and the manual refresh action still request an immediate schedule read |
| Owner documentation | Pass | The Race Control plan and user guide now describe the 60-second visible-tab interval |
| Regression | Pass | `npm run check` (0 errors/warnings/hints), `npm test` (68/68), `npm run build`, and Playwright (18 passed; 6 intentional skips) |

No Calendar or production mutation was made. The 60-second interval is a freshness/read-cost adjustment only; it does not alter final booking validation or availability safeguards.

## Schedule chrome reduction checkpoint (2026-09-17)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Owner-requested removals | Pass | Removed the workspace banner, Draft Surface badge, shared-Calendar explanatory notice, and four-cell status strip from the Schedule surface |
| Operational controls retained | Pass | Live Calendar state, refresh control, date/service/search toolbar, schedule failure/stale states, chart, inspector, booking, and block-time actions remain available |
| Desktop/mobile parity | Pass | Fresh 1440px and 375px visual screenshots show the Schedule begins directly with title and toolbar, with no displaced or duplicate chrome |
| Overflow and browser health | Pass | Playwright verified no horizontal page overflow and no browser console/request failures at 375, 390, 430, 768, 1024, and 1440px |
| Regression | Pass | `npm run check` (0 errors/warnings/hints), `npm test` (68/68), `npm run build`, and Playwright (18 passed; 6 intentional skips) |

The attached screenshot was used only to identify the owner-selected elements. No Calendar or production state changed.

## Compact homepage hours card (2026-09-23)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime summary | Pass | Unit tests cover Malaysia-local day rollover, changed weekly hours, and a same-day closure exception |
| Responsive layout | Pass | Playwright homepage check passed at 375, 390, 430, 768, 1024, and 1440px with no page overflow; cropped captures: `.impeccable/review/hours-summary/mobile-375.png` and `desktop-1440.png` |
| Link and accessibility | Pass | Playwright found one concise hours value and the `Weekly hours` link to `/visit#hours` at every required width; the core-routes check found no browser console errors or broken images |
| Regression | Pass | `npm run check` (0 errors/warnings/hints), `npm test` (126/126), `npm run build`, full Playwright suite (70 passed, 38 intentional viewport-specific skips) |

Browser checks for this checkpoint used the local Astro mock-mode server on 2026-09-23. The supplied staging screenshot was a visual reference; deployment followed in the checkpoint below. No live Calendar event or owner configuration was touched. Public-holiday policy remains an owner TODO; an explicitly published date exception is reflected in the compact card.

## Cloudflare hours-card deployment (2026-09-23)

Commit `6587800` was pushed to `origin/minor_changes` and Cloudflare uploaded branch preview version `2ea013fa-723f-4cbd-8fd5-ad714aa1ac5f` under alias `minor-changes`. `npm run build:staging` and a dry run against the generated Astro Wrangler config passed. The requested `xerom-website` URL was then deployed at Worker version `c032fa67-ba2c-4132-b943-200324bdbcdd`; Cloudflare reports that version at 100% traffic.

Read-only Playwright against `https://xerom-website.aaronbasil9400.workers.dev` passed the homepage check at 375, 390, 430, 768, 1024 and 1440px. Separate 390px and 1440px browser checks returned HTTP 200, rendered `TODAY · WED 2 pm–1 am Weekly hours`, reached `/visit#hours`, had zero horizontal overflow, and recorded no console errors or failed requests. Cropped deployed card screenshots were visually inspected. No booking, Calendar, R2 publication or owner setting was changed.

## Owner photo refresh (2026-09-26)

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Media provenance and transforms | Pass | Seven new owner photo families (three service photos, four Xerom Experience slides) have original SHA-256 hashes, crop coordinates, and 480/800/1200px derivative hashes in `src/assets/images/media-manifest.json`; `npm run assets:verify` verified all 42 manifested derivatives. The 1200px images are deterministic Lanczos resizes, not AI-generated scene content. |
| Static and unit checks | Pass | `npm run lint` and `npm run check`: 0 errors, warnings, or hints. `npm test`: 24 files, 128 tests passed, including the final-resource concurrency test. `npm run build`: passed. |
| Browser suite | Pass | Local Astro mock-mode server at `http://127.0.0.1:4324`; `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4324 npm run test:e2e`: 78 passed, 54 intentional viewport-specific skips. The first run exposed a stale three-slide test expectation; it was updated to four slides, and the full suite passed on rerun. |
| Responsive media QA | Pass | Chromium at 375, 390, 430, 768, 1024, and 1440 CSS px: no page-level overflow, broken images, browser errors, or HTTP failures. Reviewed cropped card and slideshow captures in `.impeccable/review/owner-media-2026-09-26/` and full homepage captures in `.impeccable/review/homepage-upgrade/after/`. Slideshow keyboard, touch swipe, autoplay, and reduced-motion checks passed in Playwright. |
| Design detector | Advisory | Manual Impeccable detector was run once over the changed surface. It reported broad pre-existing CSS typography/color advisories and a pre-existing layout-transition warning on unchanged rules; no new rule was introduced by this media update. |

The hero and current cafe imagery remain in place per owner direction. No live Calendar, booking, R2, or Cloudflare deployment mutation was made. Final hero and cafe/menu inputs are tracked in `CONTENT_TODO.md`.

## Booking and Race Control Experience label (2026-09-26)

- Changed only the customer WhatsApp confirmation field label from `Resources:` to `Experience:`; selected services, quantities, controller detail, booking payloads, and Calendar resource allocation are unchanged.
- Race Control's main settings navigation/title, bookings filter and column, and booking inspector now use `Experience` for the visible booking category. The block-time selector retains `Resources` because it includes the operational Booking Control calendar.
- `npm run lint` and `npm run check`: 0 errors/warnings/hints. `npm test`: 128 passed, including the final-resource concurrency test. `npm run build`: passed. Focused Playwright booking and Race Control checks: 24 passed across 375, 390, 430, 768, 1024, and 1440 CSS px. The browser test asserted the encoded WhatsApp message contains `Experience:` and the Race Control navigation, title, filter, and column use the new label.
- Local Playwright ran with mock booking mode. No live reservation or WhatsApp message was created or sent during verification.

## Mobile booking date input containment (2026-09-26)

- Owner screenshot showed the date input extending beyond the right edge of the Choose a Time form on an iPhone. The input had `width: 100%` plus padding. WebKit issue [301648](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=301648) documents an iOS-only width calculation error for padded date/time inputs; desktop WebKit does not reproduce it.
- At widths up to 900px, the date input now has no internal padding and a centered native value. The availability grid and field can shrink within their parent; desktop padding remains unchanged. The native date picker, date value, validation, and booking logic are unchanged.
- `npm run lint` and `npm run check`: 0 diagnostics. `npm test`: 128 passed, including final-resource concurrency. `npm run build`: passed. Manual Impeccable detector found 39 existing style advisories and no finding on the changed date rules.
- Chromium Playwright: 12 focused homepage/booking tests passed across 375, 390, 430, 768, 1024, and 1440 CSS px. The booking test checks the date input stays within the availability toolbar and completes a mocked reservation. A separate local WebKit/Chromium layout check found 0px date-field and document overflow at 320, 375, 390, 430, 768, 1024, and 1440 CSS px; the 390px WebKit capture at `/tmp/xerom-date-after-webkit.png` was visually reviewed.
- The first full Playwright attempt was interrupted after the local Astro server stopped; unrelated homepage tests failed while it was unavailable. A clean server restart on port 4325 produced the 12/12 focused result. iOS Safari itself remains untested in this environment, so the owner's phone is the final confirmation for the reported device.
